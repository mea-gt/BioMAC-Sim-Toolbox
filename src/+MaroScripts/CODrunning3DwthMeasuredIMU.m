%% Fixed settings

% Most of the time we use backard euler for discretization which is encoded with 'BE'.
Euler = 'BE';

% We want to plot intermediate results during solving of the problem.

%% Add objective terms to the problem
% Set the weights for each objective term (values copied from
% Jiating's code
regularizationWeight = 1e-07; %weight for regularization term. This term ensures realistic and stable solutions (no jerky movements or unrealistic muscle efforts that may violate physiological limits). It typically penlizes the magnitude of control inputs (like u=excitation) to prevent excessive use of certain muscles/actuators 
effortMusclesWeight = 0.7; %weight for effort term of muscles. This term aims at minimize energy expenditure or fatigue. It typically penalizes high muscle activations or force generation. It encourages the system to find solutions optimizing muscle efficiency.
effortTorquesWeight = 0.14; %weight for effort term of torques. This term aims at minimizing mechanical work or energy needed to produce torques at joints. It minimizes high torques. It discourages the system from relying on large torques which might be impractical or inefficent in real-world scenarios. It can reduce the mechanical strain on joints.
trackingWeight = 0.001; %weight for tracking objective. In this simulation we want to track accelerations (accelerometer) and angular velocities (gyroscope)
ratioGyroToAcc = 1000; %the ratio between the accelerometer and gyroscope weights
accWeight = 1; %weight for acceleration 
gyroWeight = accWeight*ratioGyroToAcc; %weight for angular velocities
pelvisRotationWeight = 1; %starting weight= 1


% We add a small regulatization term. This ensures smooth
% movements and helps the solver to converge more easily. 
problem.addObjective(@regTerm, regularizationWeight);

% Add the effort term for muscles.
weightsType = 'volumeweighted'; % In the effort term, we can use 'equal' or 'volumeweighted'. The first uses equal weighting for all muscles independent of their volume. The second weighs them dependent on their volume
exponentEffMusc = 3; % In the effort term, we want to use the cubic neural excitation of the muscles.
speedWeighting = 0;

problem.addObjective(@effortTermMuscles, effortMusclesWeight, weightsType, exponentEffMusc, speedWeighting);

% Add the effort term for torques
exponentEffTorq = 2;
speedWeighting = 0;
problem.addObjective(@effortTermTorques, effortTorquesWeight, exponentEffTorq, speedWeighting);

% Setup and add the tracking term. For this simulation we will be
% tracking accelerations and angular velocities from measured IMU data

%%to better results, given that higher speeds affect acceleration accuracy
%%more than they affect gyro
